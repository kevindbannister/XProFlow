# UI Working Agreement (XProFlow Frontend)

## Purpose
Define how Codex should build UI in this repo so all work stays consistent, fast, and minimal.

## Core Rules
- Use existing UI style: **minimal SaaS dashboard / Notion + Linear vibe**.
- Reuse existing components; **no duplicate components**.
- **No premature refactors** or cleanup beyond the task.
- **Build only requested pages/components** and keep diffs small.
- Always align spacing/typography to the UI rules in the style guide.
- Always output only changed files.
- **Must also follow /codex/WORKING_RULES.md**.

## Manual QA Checklist (append to every task)
- [ ] Visual layout matches the style guide (spacing, typography, color).
- [ ] Components reused (no duplicates created).
- [ ] Page structure matches the page template.
- [ ] Navigation/active states behave as specified.
- [ ] Only requested files were changed.
